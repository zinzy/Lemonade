A fair portion of the time I've invested in puppy prep so far has gone into designing this birth announcement. Since I don't want children, I've embraced the idea that I will be treating my dog like one. 

Overall, week 7 is beautiful. We finally get a puppy update, which makes it official: hi ears! Apparently the ears could flop down for a bit at some point, but for now I'm just excited to put my nose in them.

We started the McCann Dogs Puppy Essentials course after falling in love with [their great YouTube account](https://www.youtube.com/@McCannDogs). If you're considering getting a puppy, check them out: they break down dog raising into small, easy-to-handle chunks, particularly for first-time dog owners. If your dog is already a bit older but just doesn't know how to behave (hi Mary), they have stuff for that, too.
